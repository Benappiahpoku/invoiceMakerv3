- Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
- Consider touch interactions and gesture support
- Optimize for Ghana's mobile network conditions

### Key Composables

The project includes several specialized composables:

- **useInvoiceCounter.ts** - Manages invoice numbering and tracking
- **useMobileMoneyPayment.ts** - Handles mobile money payment integration
- **useNetworkStatus.ts** - Monitors network connectivity and quality
- **useOfflineStorage.ts** - Manages offline data storage and sync
- **usePWA.ts** - Handles PWA functionality and service worker
- **useToast.ts** - Manages toast notifications

### Services

- **firebase.ts** - Firebase configuration and services
- **WebVitalsService.ts** - Performance monitoring and web vitals tracking

### Component Development

- Use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Follow the established component structure:

```bash
